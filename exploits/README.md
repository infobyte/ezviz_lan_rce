# Exploits

All these exploits use the tftp client in the camera to fetch binaries that will be executed as a second stage.
These binaries are built using the `builder_image` ([more details](../builder_image/README.md)) and you have to serve them using a tftp server such as `py3tftp` before running the exploits.
